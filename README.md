Prediction of stock market trends based on Machine learning

The main purpose of the project is to develop a system which uses web services and provide some 
advice to investors about wise investing options. The system which we developed runs continuously 
in background fetches the real time and historical data of stock prices of the selected companies 
from Yahoo Finance API and process the data and store it in the relational database.  
The next step is to predict the future stock prices of the selected companies on two categories 
namely short term and long term analysis (using Bayesian and SVM algorithms respectively).
